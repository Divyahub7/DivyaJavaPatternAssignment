<h1 align="center"><u>Java Loop Practice Programs</u></h1>

This repository contains several Java files created as part of my practice to strengthen the understanding of **loops and nested loops**. Each program generates a different type of output pattern, helping me explore how iteration works in different scenarios.  

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose  
1. To practice the use of loops in Java.  
2. To get comfortable with nested iterations.  
3. To improve logical thinking and problem-solving skills through coding exercises.
